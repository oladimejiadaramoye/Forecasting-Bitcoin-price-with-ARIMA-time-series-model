# Forecasting-Bitcoin-price-with-ARIMA-time-series-model

# The project involves using an Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the price of Bitcoin. This is a classic time series forecasting task, leveraging historical price data to predict future trends.

**Problem Solved**
The main problem addressed is the prediction of future Bitcoin prices, which is a critical challenge in financial markets. Accurate predictions can aid investors and traders in making informed decisions.

**Advantages**
1. Methodological Rigor: ARIMA is a widely-accepted statistical method for time series forecasting, known for capturing linear relationships and trends in historical data.
2. Data-Driven Decisions: The model can help in making informed decisions in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.
3. Quantitative Validation: The project includes quantitative metrics like RMSE or MAE and visual plots for validating the model's accuracy.

**Disadvantages**
1. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility, which might limit the accuracy of ARIMA models.
2. Linear Assumptions: ARIMA models assume a linear relationship, which may not fully capture the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency prices.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: The performance of ARIMA models is sensitive to the choice of parameters, which requires careful selection and expertise.

**Overall**, the project showcases a structured approach to forecasting financial time series data, offering valuable insights into Bitcoin's price movement. However, the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market and the limitations of ARIMA in capturing non-linear patterns should be considered when interpreting the results.
